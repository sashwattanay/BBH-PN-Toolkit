1. It's easy to show that to write 2PN part of Hamiltonian we don't have to use the flows along J^2 and Jz.
It can be shown easiy. Try to see how does S1.n change under these two flows. Answer: it does not change.

2. How to write S1.n and S2.n as a function of flow parameters? It's not too complicated.
Cho-Lee-2019 has got the the polar and azimuthal angles of S1/S2 (kappa_1, kappa_2, \xi_3) in the 
frame centered around L vector. In the same frame r vector's angles are easy (polar = pi/2 and azimuthal is phi in Cho-Lee).

If we know the polar and azimuthal angles of 2 vectors in a frame, then there is a simple formula to find the angle b/w them (their dot product).
Hence, it's easy to write the dot product in terms of 4 action-3 angles.

3. How to average? 
	-- Taylor expand in the angle variable (conjugate tio action) and integrate. This expansion has a radius of convergence before 2 pi.
	   So, expansion works only for a sub-interval (maybe 0 < angle < pi/2). But this 0 --> pi/2 info can be used to replicate the info from 
	   pi/2 --> 2 pi. Simple! 
	-- Fourier expand and then integrate (Leo's idea). Unsure about how exactly to do it.
	
4. There is no need to root-find to get (R,P,S1,S2). Get 1.5PN AAV from 2PN AAV. Then get (R,P,S1,S2) from 1.5PN AAV because we have derived
(R,P,S1,S2) in terms of 1.5PN AAV.
