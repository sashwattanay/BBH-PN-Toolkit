1. It's easy to show that to write 2PN part of Hamiltonian we don't have to use the flows along J^2 and Jz.
It can be shown easiy. Try to see how does S1.n change under these two flows. Answer: it does not change.

2. How to write S1.n and S2.n as a function of flow parameters? It's not too complicated.
Cho-Lee-2019 has got the the polar and azimuthal angles of S1/S2 (kappa_1, kappa_2, \xi_3) in the 
frame centered around L vector. In the same frame r vector's angles are easy (polar = pi/2 and azimuthal is phi in Cho-Lee).

If we know the polar and azimuthal angles of 2 vectors in a frame, then there is a simple formula to find the angle b/w them (their dot product).
Hence, it's easy to write the dot product in terms of 4 action-3 angles.

3. How to average? 
	-- Taylor expand in the angle variable (conjugate tio action) and integrate. This expansion has a radius of convergence before 2 pi.
	   So, expansion works only for a sub-interval (maybe 0 < angle < pi/2). But this 0 --> pi/2 info can be used to replicate the info from 
	   pi/2 --> 2 pi. Simple! 
	-- Fourier expand and then integrate (Leo's idea). Unsure about how exactly to do it.
	
4. There is no need to root-find to get (R,P,S1,S2). Get 1.5PN AAV from 2PN AAV. How? See the enote and first 4 eqns on pg 346 of Jose-Saletan.
Then get (R,P,S1,S2) from 1.5PN AAV because we have derived (R,P,S1,S2) in terms of 1.5PN AAV.

5. Radiation reaction: Take basic inspiration from DGI-2004. It says that they go beyond the usual 'adiabatic' approach to combine the
thee time-scales consistently (orbital, periastron-precession and radiation).
can be handled (probably) by considering only the leadng order
terms (x_dot and e_dot). May be integrable by series expanding in e. See MMA notebook
alongside. More useful are n_dot and et_dot (found in Damour-Gopakumar-Iyer-2004) since n is connected to Hamiltonian straightforwardly (see 4PN IMR paper with Gihyuk).

Then do V (V0, action, angles) via dynamical renormalization group idea. action-angles in the parenthesis will be got by numerical integration.
Also, V0 has to be updated by V at (radiation-reaction time step of integration). V = R, P, S1, S2. So, V0 gets updated after every step size of radiation reaction time step 
of integration.

6. Maybe we can neglect oscillatory terms just like in the 4PN paper. That way, we won't have to compute the generating function which involves infinite
Fourier components. 

7. HOW TO INCLUDE ALL TERMS (orbital and spins) METHODICALLY: Get the 1.5PN AAs and (R,P,S1,S2) as functions of AAs with 3PN orbital terms included. 
This should be doable because Damour-Jaranowski-Schafer computed the 3PN actions (dynamical invariants) and Cho-Lee commented that orbital terms can be easily incorporated
in their solution (I verified it in the MMA notebook alongside). Then, perform canonical perturbation with including higher and higher spin terms. Why should this work?

Because I checked in MMA that power series solution from two sources are linearly independent, i.e. they can be added together. So, the canonical perturbation results

J = J0 + correction
\theta = theta + correction
omega = omega_0 + omega_1 + omega_2

can be added from the two sources of perturbations (orbital and spins). VVI: It does simply mean that the orbital will be QKP orbit rotating in space since for a QKP
orbit L^2 is constant and 2PN spinning Hamiltonian makes L^2 non-constant. BE CAREFUL regarding the meaning of linear independence. Here it is used in regard to
the above three additive expressions.


==================================================

POINTS OF CONCERN:

1. Writing V(V_0, angles) involves V0 vector. The above implicit way of expressing the angles V(V_0, angles)
is only for a single torus, not for the entire phase space. Is the presence of V_0 a point of concern?

-- I don't think so. Transformation b/w canonical coordinates can be like (Q,P) --> (J, \theta) or (J, \theta) --> (Q,P).
V(V_0, J, theta) is almost like the former. "Almost" because of the presence of V0. Now let's talk about avergaing over theta's.
When we try to write V(V_0, J, theta), it will have 2PN Hamiltonian = H_{2PN} containing terms like sin/cos (theta - theta_0 (V0))
and we have to avergae over theta. Now, set theta_0 = 0 (just ignore it). Why can we do that? Because H_{2PN} is periodic in
theta with period = 2 pi. The integral will only be a function of the J's, as a naive student might expect, as if they
averaged V(J, theta) which does not (purportedly) have V_0. 

As an example, take a 1 DOF case: q = J cos(phi + phi_0); p = J sin(phi + phi_0); phi_0 = arctan(p_0/q_0). Then set phi_0 = 0
before integrating.

But we have to be careful since our 1.5PN work is perturbative. J_4 is perturbative. Flow under H is perturbatively known (Gihyuk's paper).

Is there a way to get V(J, theta) from V(V_0, J, theta)? I think yes. Take inspiration from the 1 DOF example above. Put phi_0 = 0
and write q = J cos(phi); p = J sin(phi). This gives a legit V(J, theta). Similarly find the equivalent of phi_0 in the spinning
BBH scenario and put that = 0. That should do it. The result should satisfy the criterion that a small change in J (keeping phi constant)
should lead to an infinitesimal change in the spacetime point. Once a legit V(J, theta) is obtained, then there are no conceptual issues with averaging.


2. The problem can be worked on in increasing levels of sophistication: 
	-- ignore 1PN and 2PN orbital Hamiltonian
	-- ignore the oscillatory parts from perturbation theory
	-- ignore the radiation reaction effects
	-- don't compute h(R,P,S1,S2)
	-- perform the angular average of the perturbing Hamiltonian numerically after having differentiated wrt. the actions analytically (to get the frequencies).
	   Once done, it does not have to be performed again since J's are constant.
	   
    -- do Newtonian + 1.5PN
    -- add 1PN and 2PN orbital Hamiltonian; give h(R,P,S1,S2)
    -- add radiation reaction; we may now want to perform the angular average analytically using wrap-around properties of elliptic functions/integrals (as discussed above)
