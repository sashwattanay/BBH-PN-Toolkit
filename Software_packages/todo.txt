1) Make the algorithm for finding spin solutions without going to subspin space


2) by Sashwat: make the package handle both m1 > m2 and m1 < m2. It's very easy.

3. change the package name to PNspinningBBHtoolkit or PN-spinning-BBH-Toolkit or something.
I don't know if hyphen is sllowed in the name or not.

4) See if we can adjust the t=0 shift in the Hamiltonian code.
