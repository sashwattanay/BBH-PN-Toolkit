1) Make the algorithm for finding spin solutions without going to subspin space
2) Make the convention of (Q1,Q2) and spins consistent in all files (checked but may need to 
revisit during action flows)
3) Check expressions in frequency code.

4) by Sashwat: make the package handle both m1 > m2 and m1 < m2. It's very easy.

5. change the package name to PNspinningBBHtoolkit or PN-spinning-BBH-Toolkit or something.
I don't know if hyphen is sllowed in the name or not.
